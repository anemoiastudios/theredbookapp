The red book for anemoia studios

## Getting started 
1. make sure you have flutter, dart android studio/vscode installed [pre requisite].
2. run "flutter doctor" to make sure flutter is all good and ready to run
3. install an emulator of your choice and make sure you have android SDK set for 33 + / Ios 15 + to run it smoothly.
4. make sure to check the project structure and see all paths are implemented correctly for dart flutter.
5. run "pub upgrade" and "pub get" on pubspec.yaml file of the project to install dependencies.
6. start the emultor, and run the project main.dart file.
7. try logging in with the test email id : anemoiastudios@gmail.com and passcode: Anemoia@1 -- sometimes might need access of sponsor. 
8. And you should be good to play around the app and browse through.

* current backend is disable due to sponsor decision and only has the manually added mock data.

3. make sure you get familiar with android studios or vscode. 
4. try looking at the contrubtion already made, understand the code and try to implement additions, deletions of your ideas on.
5. if a team of 4+ is working on it make sure you go branch you work and pull it to main on a time line basis to not run into a permanant error.

## note to sponsor : how to unlock backend:

2. create a .dart file in project and paste the API key file and call database collection, authentication, and analytics and return them.
3. after finishing this process without error, you can repalce all post widgets with manual data by mapping on collections of the user data in database.
