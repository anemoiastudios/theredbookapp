The red book for anemoia studios

##Getting started 
1. make sure you have flutter, dart android studio/vscode installed [pre requisite].
2. run "flutter doctor" to make sure flutter is all good and ready to run
3. install an emulator of your choice and make sure you have android SDK set for 33 + / Ios 15 + to run it smoothly.
4. make sure to check the project structure and see all paths are implemented correctly for dart flutter.
5. run "pub upgrade" and "pub get" on pubspec.yaml file of the project to install dependencies.
6. start the emultor, and run the project main.dart file.
7. try logging in with the test email id : anemoiastudios@gmail.com and passcode: Anemoia@1 -- sometimes might need access of sponsor. 
8. And you should be good to play around the app and browse through.

** current backend is disable due to sponsor decision and only has the manually added mock data.

## note to sponsor : how to unlock backend: 
1. install firebase plugins, get the API key of the firebase.
2. create a .dart file in project and paste the API key file and call database collection, authentication, and analytics and return them.
3. after finishing this process without error, you can repalce all post widgets with manual data by mapping on collections of the user data in database.
